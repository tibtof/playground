#Simple Spock Tutorial
Started from [Spock Tutorial for Beginners](https://examples.javacodegeeks.com/core-java/spock-tutorial-beginners/).

Notes on the tutorial:
- is not TDD
- too verbose class creation explanations
- covers some very basic features

Trying to follow it in a TDD style got me to ask this this SO question: [Create a Java class from a groovy test file in IntelliJ](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40057933/create-a-java-class-from-a-groovy-test-file-in-intellij).
